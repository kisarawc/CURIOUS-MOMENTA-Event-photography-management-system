		Among the best photographers in Sri Lanka, I’m Prabath Kanishka, a passionate pre-wedding shoot photographer, a model photographer, a portrait photographer, and I humbly recognize myself to be one of the best wedding photographers in Sri Lanka. I love to see how happily you embrace it when I balance the perfect harmony between your story and my photography.</p>

        I freeze special moments in just the right time on your big day so that you can pass them down and cherish them in generations to come.
        Unlike typical weding photographers in Sri Lanka, I capture the most natural moments through my weding photography in Sri Lanka.
        I love to delight my clients with beautiful portraits using natural lighting so that they can recall every moment of their  weding photoshoot with genuine happiness.
