# CURIOUS-MOMENTA: Event Photography Web Application

## Overview
**CURIOUS-MOMENTA** is a web application developed for an event photography business. The platform allows users to manage their profiles, view pricing plans, provide feedback, and book photography packages.

## Description
The application was built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL, enabling users to:
- Create an account and manage their profiles.
- View pricing plans for various photography packages.
- Provide feedback on services.
- Book photography packages and process payments.

As the team leader of a group of five members, I oversaw the project and managed the profile management section for both admin and users. This feature allows users to change account details, update passwords, and delete their accounts if necessary.
